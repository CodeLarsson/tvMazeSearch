This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## If I had more time

I failed to get the testing environment working within the stated time. I just couldn't get Jest working correctly.

I also would have spent more time on styling and accesability if I had more time. Since the instructions said that the assignment should take around 5 hours to complete I wanted to stay within that limit.

Since I am familliar to React, but not React Native, it took a little longer for me to get up on speed about which components to use and how to set up the routing screens.

I also would have liked to implement more features, like a user profile and a list of favourite shows.

Over all I am not super pleased with the what I have made, however, since I have not worked with React Native before, I think it went better than I had expected.
